Pre-requisites for working on this program are:
- Rust programming language
- NodeJs + NPM

To run the program in development mode for the first time:
- Execute `npm i` to install the necessary Node packages *and*
- Execute `npm run tauri dev` to run the application.

After the necessary packages are installed using `npm i`,
running `npm i` is only necessary if new packages are added to `package.json`.
Otherwise, you can simply execute `npm run tauri dev` thereafter.
